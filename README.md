### Simplified Batch training with Watson Studio
Batch training in Watson Studio was designed to be flexibile and fit into a range of pre-existing deep learning workflows. However this flexibility can be daunting for new users so these utils expose the core functions required to start experiment quickly while providing the source code so you can dig deeper as you advance.



### Quick Start
If you want more detailed setup instructions, then see the next section below setup.  Otherwise it's a simple 4-step process. (1) cloning the repository then (2) [install the Watson Machine Learning (WML) python client](https://wml-api-pyclient-dev.mybluemix.net/).  (3) if you're already familiar with WML and Cloud Object Storage, then you simply copy your credentials to [wml_credentials.json](settings/wml_credentials.json) and [cos_credentials.json](settings/cos_credentials.json), and (4) [execute the examples scripts showcasing sample batch experiments]().
